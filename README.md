# dot-templates

> Create your own collection of dotfiles and each time you need them just run dots

## ‚å®Ô∏è Setup

1. Download this repo

2. change the following lines from src/ui-options.ts

```text
const user = "ayonious";
const repo = "dot-templates";
const templatesLocation = "templates";
```

3. Now install your package like this

```bash
npm install
npx tsc
npm link
```

This will setup this took in your computer. Now goto any folder and run

```
dots
```

## ÔøΩ The Idea

dots should be able to fetch files remotely from github and put it in current repository.

The input should be:

1. Remote URL of files
2. Which files are needed

## üìÖ To be worked later

1. Api rate limit. Add cache or maybe Oauth
2. ability to configure this CLI after the first installation.
3. Multiple Folder inputting, currently only from one folder I can get all templates
